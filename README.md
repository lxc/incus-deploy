# Incus deployment tools

This is a collection of Ansible playbooks, Terraform configurations and scripts to deploy and operate Incus clusters.

## How to get the test setup run:
### Install Incus and OpenTofu
Install Incus stable or LTS on your system from the [zabbly/incus](https://github.com/zabbly/incus) release and initialize it on your local machine.

Install [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/).

Install the required ceph packages for Ansible on the controller, on Debian that's the `ceph-base` and `ceph-common` packages:
```
apt install --no-install-recommends ceph-base ceph-common
```

### Create the test VMs with OpenTofu
Go to terraform directory:
```
cd terraform/
```

Init the terraform project:
```
tofu init
```

Create 5 VMs and associated networks and storage volumes for testing an Incus cluster:
If your Incus host needs different values from the default, you may need
to copy `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars` and update the
variables.

```
tofu apply -target=module.baremetal
```

### Run the Ansible Playbook
Go to the repository root directory:
```
cd ../
```

NOTE: If you need the same version of Ansible this was tested with:
```
pyenv install 3.13.1
pipenv --python "3.13.1" install
pipenv shell
ansible-galaxy install -r ansible_requirements.yml
```

NOTE: If you are connecting to a remote Incus host you will need to change the `ansible_incus_remote` variable to match the name of the Incus remote (see: `incus remote list` for a list of remote names to use).

Run the Playbooks:
```
ansible-playbook -i inventories/baremetal.yaml deploy.yaml
```

NOTE: When re-deploying the same cluster (e.g. following a `terraform destroy`),
you need to make sure to also clear any local state from the
`data` directory, failure to do so will cause Ceph/OVN to attempt
connection to the previously deployed systems which will cause the
deployment to get stuck.

```
rm data/ceph/*
rm data/lvmcluster/*
rm data/ovn/*
```

### Test a VM and Container on the new Incus cluster

```
# Open a shell on one of the Incus cluster nodes
incus exec server01 bash

# List all instances
incus list

# Launch a system container
incus launch images:ubuntu/22.04 ubuntu-container

# Launch a virtual machine
incus launch images:ubuntu/22.04 ubuntu-vm --vm

# Launch an application container
incus remote add oci-docker https://docker.io --protocol=oci
incus launch oci-docker:hello-world --ephemeral --console
incus launch oci-docker:nginx nginx-app-container
```

## Deploying against production systems
### Requirements (when using Incus with both Ceph and OVN)

 - At least 3 servers
 - One main network interface (or bond/VLAN), referred to as `enp5s0` in the examples
 - One additional network interface (or bond/VLAN) to use for ingress into OVN, referred to as `enp6s0` in the examples
 - Configured IPv4/IPv6 subnets on that additional network interface, in the examples, we're using:
   - IPv4 subnet: `172.31.254.0/24`
   - IPv4 gaterway: `172.31.254.1`
   - IPv6 subnet: `fd00:1e4d:637d:1234::/64`
   - IPv6 gateway: `fd00:1e4d:637d:1234::1`
   - DNS server: `1.1.1.1`
 - A minimum of 3 disks (or partitions) on distinct servers across the cluster for consumption by Ceph, in the examples, we're using (on each server):
   - `nvme-QEMU_NVMe_Ctrl_incus_disk1`
   - `nvme-QEMU_NVMe_Ctrl_incus_disk2`
 - A minimum of 1 disk (or partition) on each server for local storage, that's `/dev/disk/by-id/nvme-QEMU_NVMe_Ctrl_incus_disk3` in the examples

### Configuring Ansible

With a deployment against physical servers, Terraform isn't currently used at all.
Ansible will be used to deploy Ceph, OVN and Incus on the servers.

You'll need to create a new `hosts.yaml` which you can base on the example one provided.

You'll then need to do the following changes at minimum:
 - Generate a new `ceph_fsid` (use `uuidgen`)
 - Set a new `incus_name`
 - Set a new `ovn_name`
 - Update the number and name of servers to match the FQDN of your machines
 - Ensure that you have 3 servers with the `mon` `ceph_role` and 3 servers with the `central` `ovn_role`
 - Update the connection details to fit your deployment:
   - Unset `ansible_connection`, `ansible_incus_remote`, `ansible_user` and `ansible_become` as those are specific to our test environment
   - Set the appropriate connection information to access your servers (`ansible_connection`, `ansible_user`, SSH key, ...)
 - Update the list of ceph and local disks for each servers (look at `/dev/disk/by-id` for identifiers)
 - Tweak the `incus_init` variable to match your environment

You'll find more details about the Ansible configuration options in [ansible/README.md](ansible/README.md).
